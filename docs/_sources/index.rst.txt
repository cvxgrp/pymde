PyMDE: Minimum-Distortion Embedding
====================================

PyMDE is a Python library for computing vector :ref:`embeddings <embedding_definition>`
of items, such as images, biological cells, nodes in a network, or any other
type of abstract object. The embeddings are designed to minimally distort
relationships between pairs of items, while possibly satisfying some
constraints.

For more background about the methods that PyMDE uses,
please see our monograph |paperlink|, which introduces a simple but general
framework for embedding.

  <em><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/min_dist_emb.html">Minimum-Distortion Embedding</a></em>

You can use PyMDE to:

* visualize datasets, small or large;
* embed into arbitrarily large dimensions (much greater than 2 or 3);
* generate feature vectors for supervised learning;
* compress high-dimensional vector data;
* draw graphs;
* and more.

Unlike other popular embedding methods, PyMDE also lets you

* compute large embeddings quickly, using a GPU;
* fit embeddings that satisfy constraints, such as having uncorrelated
  feature columns;
* design custom embeddings (and recreate well-known ones, like PCA, Laplacian eigenmap, LargeVis, and UMAP);
* sanity-check embeddings using principled methods;
* look for outliers in original data.


Example
-------
Here's an example that shows how to use PyMDE to visualize high-dimensional
vectors (which in this case are images from the MNIST dataset).

.. code:: python3

	import pymde

	mnist = pymde.datasets.MNIST()
	embedding = pymde.preserve_neighbors(mnist.data, embedding_dim=2, verbose=True).embed()
	pymde.plot(embedding, color_by=mnist.attributes['digits'])


.. image:: files/mnist.png

Each point represents an image in the dataset, and every point is colored
by the digit represented by its underlying image. However, only the raw
pixel data was used to create the embedding. This example embedded into two
dimensions, allowing us to plot the result, but PyMDE supports embedding into
much larger dimensions.


This is just one of the many things that PyMDE can do.

Why use PyMDE?
--------------

There are many reasons to try out PyMDE. Here are some.

**PyMDE is expressive.**
PyMDE is based on a simple but general framework for embedding, called
*Minimum-Distortion Embedding* (MDE). The MDE framework generalizes well-known
methods like PCA, spectral embedding, multi-dimensional scaling, LargeVis, and
UMAP. With PyMDE, it is easy to recreate well-known embeddings and to create
new ones, tailored to your particular application.

Unlike other embedding methods, PyMDE lets you impose
constraints on the embedding. For example, the below GIFs show PyMDE computing
three different kinds of embeddings of MNIST. The first and third
embeddings are constrained to be *standardized* (which roughly means they have
uncorrelated features), while the second is unconstrained. Standardized
embeddings are favorably scaled for downstream machine learning tasks, such
as supervised learning.

**PyMDE is easy to use.**
It's easy to get started with PyMDE. With just one line of code, you can
embed high-dimensional vectors or the nodes of a graph into any target
dimension. Creating custom embeddings is also
easy, because PyMDE separates the description of an embedding from how it is
computed: you say what kind of embedding you want, and PyMDE will compute it
for you.

In addition to computing embeddings, PyMDE can plot them (if
the embedding dimension is three or less), create GIFs of the embedding
process, help you compare different embeddings, preprocess your data, and
more.

**PyMDE is principled.**
The MDE framework provides principled methods to debug and analyze
embeddings. These methods can be used to make your embeddings more faithful
to your original data, and to search for anomalies and outliers in the original
data.

**PyMDE is fast.**
PyMDE is competitive in runtime with more specialized embedding methods, like
UMAP, and can scale to datasets with millions of items. With a GPU, it can be
even faster. PyMDE scales well with the embedding dimension, meaning that you
can easily embed into dimensions such as 50, 100, or 250.

PyMDE draws graphs orders of magnitude faster than NetworkX.
